# RaspberryPi
First RaspberryPi Setup and build.
Raspberry PI 5 Documentation: 04/13/2024
Remove all items from their box or plastic coverings and place them on a clean, level surface, except for the microSD card. Leave the microSD card in the static shield until the appropriate step.
1.	Disassemble the case into three (3) parts: bottom plate, middle insert, and top plate. Set each part beside the other for preparation.

2.	Remove the case fan header cap from the motherboard.

3.	Insert the case fan plug into on the enclosure on the motherboard with the yellow wire face out – to the edge of the motherboard.

4.	With the fan sitting on the side of the motherboard, grab the CanaKit heat sink and line it up with the CPU and other capacitors to find the correct alignment. Once the alignment is found, remove the thermal pad coverings, and slowly seat the heat sink onto the CPU and relative capacitors. Firmly press on the heat sink at the major contact points to evenly distribute the thermal pad adhesion.
NOTICE: the capacitor near the Ethernet port will be angled differently to help align the heat sink. Use this to help get the best displacement of the heat sink as possible. 
5.	At approximately 15-20 degrees, seat the motherboard’s right side into the right side of the case’s bottom plate until the edge is above the microSD card slot, but underneath the retaining hooks. Once the right side is snug underneath the retaining hooks, slowly lower the left side of the motherboard down into the bottom plate until it is seated.

6.	Place the case fan on top of the heat sink, align the case’s middle insert with the appropriate ports, and lower the middle insert down onto the bottom plate until it is firmly seated by the confirmation of a clicking noise.

7.	With the case fan still connected to the motherboard, gently lift the case fan from the case and attach it to the case’s top plate.

NOTICE: The case’s top plate inserts and brackets are positioned for one orientation – the case’s fan can be attached to the top plate in one way. 

8.	With the case fan wires secured, slowly lower the top plate onto the middle insert until a clicking noise is heard, ensuring it is properly secured.

That’s it! Congratulations, you have just assembled your first of many Raspberry Pi!
